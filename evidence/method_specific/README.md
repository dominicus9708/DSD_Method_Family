# Method-Specific Evidence / 개별 방법 직접 증거

This folder records evidence that directly tests one of the **22 independent DSD methods**. Evidence does not transfer automatically between methods merely because methods share a higher-level field or common DSD source layers.

## Current inheritance policy / 현재 상속 정책

- Shared-rule lessons may be cross-referenced but do not automatically become another method's direct validation.
- Maturity/status audits do not themselves increase the audited method's direct-pilot count.
- Independent-evaluator packet preparation is infrastructure until an eligible external submission exists.
- Failed challenge designs remain historical evidence of test pressure but do not fill successful validation categories.
- A success or failure in one case does not by itself imply that a method must survive, merge, be absorbed, or be deleted. Method independence is assessed separately.
- Established method/protocol evidence maturity does not permanently freeze the method registry.

### `design/` — DSD Design / DSD 설계론

```text

### `synthesis/` — DSD Synthesis / DSD 합성론

Planning opened `2026-09-10`; executable `PROTOCOL_v0.1.md` was established at commit `8787b24`.

Current Synthesis state after `SYN-AUD-001` and `SYN-IEP-001` preparation:

```text

```

Key Synthesis evidence includes `SYN-CH-001` through `SYN-CH-007`, three external applications, `SYN-AUD-001`, and the prepared `SYN-IEP-001` packet. The next Synthesis evidence event requires a genuinely separate evaluator submission frozen before reference reveal.

### `comparison/` — DSD Comparison / DSD 비교론

Planning opened `2026-09-10`; executable `PROTOCOL_v0.1.md` was established at commit `a1700d960e0b41dfe32bf85b6334448d9104100d` after 16 pre-protocol boundary attacks.

Current Comparison state:

```text
DEDICATED_COMPARISON_PROTOCOL: v0.1 established
PROTOCOL_CREATION_COMMIT: a1700d960e0b41dfe32bf85b6334448d9104100d
PRE_PROTOCOL_BOUNDARY_ATTACKS: 16
BOUNDARY_PRESERVED_NO_REFINEMENT: 11
BOUNDARY_PRESERVED_WITH_NONBREAKING_REFINEMENT: 5
BOUNDARY_COLLAPSE_FOUND: 0
FUNDAMENTAL_INTERFACE_FAILURE: 0
DIRECT_COMPARISON_PILOTS: 0
POSITIVE_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
NEGATIVE_OR_FAILURE_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
BOUNDARY_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
NO_GAIN_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
BASELINE_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
REPRODUCIBILITY_CASES: 0
EXTERNAL_COMPARISON_APPLICATIONS: 0
INDEPENDENT_COMPARISON_VALIDATION: not established
COMPARISON_METHOD_MATURITY_CLASSIFICATION: proposed
CURRENT_COMPARISON_EVIDENCE_STATUS: validation_pending
```

Protocol lineage:

```text
methods/06_comparison/TASK_INTERFACE_v0.1-draft.md
+ methods/06_comparison/TASK_INTERFACE_BOUNDARY_AMENDMENT_001.md
-> methods/06_comparison/PROTOCOL_v0.1.md
```

Current Comparison guards:

```text
AGGREGATE_EQUALITY != STRUCTURAL_EQUIVALENCE
ONE_MAP_FAILURE != GLOBAL_NONCORRESPONDENCE
COMMON_LABEL != COMMON_COORDINATE_OR_SEMANTIC_ROLE
EMBEDDING != STRICT_EQUIVALENCE
FIRST_OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE != FIRST_JUSTIFIED_BRANCH_POINT
PARTIAL_CORRESPONDENCE != GLOBAL_EQUIVALENCE
ENCODING_REQUIRED_CORRESPONDENCE != DIRECT_CORRESPONDENCE
FORWARD_MAP_SUCCESS != REVERSE_MAP_SUCCESS
MAP_FAMILY_COVERAGE != COMPARISON_ELEMENT_COVERAGE
UNSUPPLIED_NORMALIZATION_OR_CONVERSION != COMPARISON_MAP
DYNAMIC_TRAJECTORY_SIMILARITY != SHARED_LINEAGE_OR_IDENTITY
MISSING_COMPARISON_BRIDGE != PROVEN_STRUCTURAL_DIFFERENCE
```

Protocol establishment is infrastructure and does not fill a direct-evidence category. The next Comparison event is a separately precommitted `CMP-CH-001` positive direct challenge.

## Promotion expectation / 성숙도 승격 기준

A proposed/developing method should accumulate, at minimum, a dedicated method protocol; positive, negative/failure, boundary and `NO_GAIN` cases; reproducibility records; external or independently generated applications; and a strongest-reasonable-baseline comparison when applicable. These are evidence categories, not automatic promotion rules. Same-project retrace does not substitute for independent review, and external-application count does not establish practical superiority or method survival.
