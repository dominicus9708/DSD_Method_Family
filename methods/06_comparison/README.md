# 06. DSD Comparison / DSD 비교론

Status: **Protocol v0.1 established / direct validation pending**

Task: compare two or more supplied structures without reducing comparison to final-output equality, and determine justified correspondence, preserved structure, divergence, strict-equivalence status, and earliest supported branching only within declared comparison/map/element coverage.

Primary DSD sources: strict equivalence, structure-preserving maps, stage comparison, first branching, Property-stage comparison, Channel-Indexed Static Aggregation as a separate readout source, and optional dynamic comparison with lineage claims gated separately.

## Core method form

```text
supplied subjects
+ declared comparison scope/resolution
+ supplied map/correspondence family
+ preservation/equivalence criteria
-> correspondence/divergence profile
```

## Executable protocol and lineage

Current executable protocol: `PROTOCOL_v0.1.md`, creation commit `a1700d960e0b41dfe32bf85b6334448d9104100d`.

```text
TASK_INTERFACE_v0.1-draft.md
+ TASK_INTERFACE_BOUNDARY_AMENDMENT_001.md
-> PROTOCOL_v0.1.md
```

Historical planning artifacts remain preserved and are not rewritten after protocol freeze.

## Core guards

```text
AGGREGATE_EQUALITY != STRUCTURAL_EQUIVALENCE
ONE_MAP_FAILURE != GLOBAL_NONCORRESPONDENCE
COMMON_LABEL != COMMON_COORDINATE_OR_SEMANTIC_ROLE
EMBEDDING != STRICT_EQUIVALENCE
FIRST_OBSERVED_DIFFERENCE != FIRST_JUSTIFIED_BRANCH_POINT
PARTIAL_CORRESPONDENCE != GLOBAL_EQUIVALENCE
ENCODING_REQUIRED_CORRESPONDENCE != DIRECT_CORRESPONDENCE
SIMILAR_OUTPUT != SHARED_LINEAGE_OR_IDENTITY
FORWARD_MAP_SUCCESS != REVERSE_MAP_SUCCESS
MAP_FAMILY_COVERAGE != COMPARISON_ELEMENT_COVERAGE
UNSUPPLIED_NORMALIZATION_OR_CONVERSION != COMPARISON_MAP
DYNAMIC_TRAJECTORY_SIMILARITY != SHARED_LINEAGE_OR_IDENTITY
MISSING_COMPARISON_BRIDGE != PROVEN_STRUCTURAL_DIFFERENCE
```

## Output / relation / terminal structure

```text
OUTPUT_LEVELS:
  COMPARISON_PROFILE
  CORRESPONDENCE_CLASSIFICATION
  STRICT_EQUIVALENCE_DECISION
  FIRST_BRANCH_POINT
  PARTIAL_COMPARISON

RELATION_CLASSES:
  STRICT_EQUIVALENT
  DIRECT_CORRESPONDENCE
  PARTIAL_CORRESPONDENCE
  ENCODED_CORRESPONDENCE
  NONCORRESPONDENCE
  UNDETERMINED_CORRESPONDENCE

TERMINAL_COMPARISON_STATUS:
  COMPARISON_RESOLVED
  COMPARISON_UNDERDETERMINED
  COMPARISON_BLOCKED
```

A resolved comparison may resolve to equivalence, correspondence, or justified noncorrespondence. `UNDERDETERMINED` preserves incomplete closure; `BLOCKED` preserves missing claim-required records or bridges.

## Protocol-v0.1 forced locks

Boundary attacks forced explicit locks for:

```text
MAP_PROPERTY_REQUIREMENT_PROFILE
REVERSE_DIRECTION_OR_INVERSE_POLICY
COMPARISON_ELEMENT_COVERAGE
CLOSURE_REQUIREMENT_BY_OUTPUT_LEVEL
PRECOMPARISON_TRANSFORMATION_POLICY
REPRESENTATION_PROVENANCE
LINEAGE_IDENTITY_CLAIM_POLICY
LINEAGE_EVIDENCE_SOURCE_OR_HANDOFF
```

This keeps map-family coverage separate from structural-element coverage, forward correspondence separate from reverse/inverse claims, supplied transformed representations separate from hidden Transformation, and similarity separate from lineage identity.

## Step-2 boundary result

```text
BOUNDARY_ATTACKS_RUN: 16
PRESERVED_NO_REFINEMENT: 11
PRESERVED_WITH_NONBREAKING_REFINEMENT: 5
BOUNDARY_COLLAPSE_FOUND: 0
FUNDAMENTAL_INTERFACE_FAILURE: 0
DIRECT_COMPARISON_PILOT_INCREMENT: 0
```

## Method boundaries

```text
Analysis: internal decomposition/description
Comparison: cross-subject preservation/correspondence/divergence
Classification: taxonomy-based class assignment
Transformation: source -> target representation/regime
Audit: retrace/evaluate an existing process or verdict
Provenance/Lineage: historical/source/successor identity chain
Aggregation: admitted structure/data -> declared readout
```

Comparison may consume neighboring-method outputs but does not absorb their operations or verdicts.

## Three ledgers

```text
TERMINAL_COMPARISON_STATUS
COMPARISON_PROTOCOL_CONFORMANCE
COMPARISON_METHOD_GAIN_STATUS
```

Method gain is assessed only against a separately frozen competent baseline.

## Current evidence state

```text
DEDICATED_COMPARISON_PROTOCOL: v0.1 established
PROTOCOL_CREATION_COMMIT: a1700d960e0b41dfe32bf85b6334448d9104100d
PRE_PROTOCOL_BOUNDARY_ATTACKS: 16
DIRECT_COMPARISON_PILOTS: 0
POSITIVE_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
NEGATIVE_OR_FAILURE_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
BOUNDARY_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
NO_GAIN_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
BASELINE_COMPARISON_CASES: 0
REPRODUCIBILITY_CASES: 0
EXTERNAL_COMPARISON_APPLICATIONS: 0
INDEPENDENT_COMPARISON_VALIDATION: not established
COMPARISON_METHOD_MATURITY_CLASSIFICATION: proposed
CURRENT_COMPARISON_EVIDENCE_STATUS: validation_pending
```

Protocol establishment is infrastructure and does not count as a direct pilot.

## Next development step

Precommit and execute `CMP-CH-001` positive direct challenge. It should jointly exercise strict equivalence with sufficient closure, weaker direct correspondence, encoded correspondence, aggregate collision without structural inflation, explicit map-property/element-coverage records, and three-ledger separation.

Case success/failure does not decide method survival, merger, absorption, or deletion.
